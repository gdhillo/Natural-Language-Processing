# Natural Language Processing

In this assignment we will work on analyzing text data. A tremendous amount of data is available as text data, from digitized books, documents, articles, to customer reviews and social media exchanges. However, analyzing this data requires different processing steps, as compared to quantitative data, that we will explore here.

Tasks / Learning Goals
- To work with analyzing text data, exploring natural language processing
- Explore different methods to encode text data
- In particular, ‘Bag of Words’ and TF/IDF approaches - Practice classification models, in particular, using SVMs

Associated Data Files
- data/rt-polarity.tsv
- data/custrev_train.tsv
